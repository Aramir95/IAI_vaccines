 **About VAERS.**
 
 - The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) established VAERS, which is co-administered by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), to accept all reports of suspected adverse events, in all age groups, after the administration of any U.S. licensed vaccine.
 - The primary purpose for maintaining the database is to serve as an early warning or signaling system for adverse events not detected during pre-market testing.

**Careful points about this data set**

1. VAERS data are from a *passive surveillance system and represent unverified reports* of health events that occur after vaccination.
2. The event may have been related to an underlying disease or condition, to medications being taken concurrently, or may have occurred by chance.
3. VAERS data should be used with caution as numbers and conditions do not reflect data collected during follow-up.
4. Note that the inclusion of events in VAERS data does not infer causality.

 **About the data codification**
 
 - On 1/17/2007 the VAERS coding system was converted (from an older system: Coding Symbols for a
Thesaurus of Adverse Reaction Terms (COSTART) used until 2007) to an international coding system that is used worldwide: Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) which is more detailed.

**MedDRA** uses key words representing the medical condition(s) described in the case report and converts them to standardized codes. Here this dataset uses more than 17000 "Preferred Terms" MedDRA codes. Codes are updated semi-annually (here on COVID19, we have collected version 23.1 and 24.0).

 **About the data.**
 
About 85-90% of vaccine adverse event reports concern relatively minor events, such as fevers or redness and swelling at the injection site. The remaining reports (less than 15%) describe serious events, such as hospitalizations, life-threatening illnesses, or deaths.

> No data is provided that would allow identification of any individuals associated with these reports.

**Data Collection:** Based on 2 form versions, online version (on websites) and [printing pdf version](2021-03_VAERSForm.pdf). Referred on the data set as (VAERS 1 and VAERS 2).
 
**Structure:** The downloadable VAERS public data set consists of **3 separate data files**.
1. VAERSDATA.CSV - provides a detailed description of the data provided in each field.
2. VAERSVAX.CSV - provide the remaining vaccine information (vaccine name, manufacturer, lot number, route, site, and number of previous doses administered), for each of the vaccines listed. **VAX_DOSE was discontinued in the VAERS 2 form.**
3. VAERSSYMPTOMS.CSV - provide the adverse event coded terms utilizing the MedDRA dictionary. **Each row in the .csv will contain up to 5 MedDRA terms per VAERS ID; thus, there could be multiple rows per VAERS ID.** For each of the VAERS_IDâ€™s listed in the VAERSDATA.CSV table, there is a matching record in this file, identified by VAERS_ID, **Duplicates may appear in data** and terms are listed in alphabetical order. In case a report has more than 5 terms multiple rows with 5 terms each will be listed for that VAERS ID.

**Data Types**
1. NUM (float64) = numeric data
2. CHAR (object) = text or "character" data
3. DATE (not formated) = date fields in mm/dd/yy format
